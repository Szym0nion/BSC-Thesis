\newcommand{\Streszczenie}{Celem projektu inżynierskiego jest opracowanie i implementacja aplikacji mobilnej mającej na celu monitorowanie czasu reakcji, oraz wykonaniu systemu pomiarowego, dla akwizycji sygnałów saturacji krwi oraz częstości rytmu serca na bazie fali tętna. Istotnym składnikiem pracy dyplomowej było wykonanie badań oraz analiza ich wyników na trzech różnych grupach pacjentów: osobach nieaktywnych fizycznie, kolarzach oraz himalaistach z wykorzystaniem opracowanego, autorskiego systemu pomiarowego.

W ramach projektu, opracowano aplikację mobilną, której głównym zadaniem jest pomiar czasu reakcji użytkownika na określone bodźce. Aplikacja została zoptymalizowana pod kątem precyzji pomiarów, a zebrane dane posłużyły do analizy szybkości reakcji w różnych grupach badawczych.

Dodatkowo, zaimplementowano układ pomiarowy zdolny monitorować saturację krwi oraz falę tętna. Układ ten został zastosowany w badaniach na trzech grupach pacjentów. W grupie osób nieaktywnych fizycznie, analizowano wpływ braku aktywności fizycznej na parametry zdrowotne. W przypadku kolarzy, oceniano adaptacje układu krążenia do intensywnego wysiłku fizycznego, natomiast w grupie himalaistów - wpływ ekstremalnych warunków atmosferycznych na parametry krwi.

Wyniki badań wskazują na istotne różnice pomiędzy grupami, co potwierdza zróżnicowane reakcje organizmu w zależności od poziomu aktywności fizycznej i specyfiki wykonywanej działalności. Wyniki te mogą mieć istotne znaczenie dla dziedziny medycyny sportowej oraz rehabilitacji, sugerując konieczność dostosowania programów zdrowotnych do indywidualnych potrzeb pacjentów o różnym stopniu aktywności fizycznej.}

\newcommand{\StreszczenieANG}{The aim of the engineering project is to develop and implement a mobile application aimed at monitoring reaction time, and to create a measurement system for the acquisition of blood saturation signals and heart rate based on the pulse wave. An important component of the diploma thesis was carrying out research and analyzing its results on three different groups of patients: physically inactive people, cyclists and mountain climbers using a developed, proprietary measurement system.

As part of the project, a mobile application was developed, with its primary task being the measurement of user reaction time to specific stimuli. The application was optimized for measurement precision, and the collected data were used to analyze reaction speed in various research groups.

Additionally, a measurement system capable of monitoring blood oxygen saturation and pulse wave was implemented. This system was applied in studies involving three groups of patients. In the group of physically inactive individuals, the impact of a lack of physical activity on health parameters was analyzed. For cyclists, adaptations of the circulatory system to intense physical exertion were evaluated, while in the Himalayan climber group, the influence of extreme atmospheric conditions on blood parameters was examined.

The research results indicate significant differences between the groups, confirming varied physiological responses depending on the level of physical activity and the nature of the performed activities. These findings may have significant implications for the field of sports medicine and rehabilitation, suggesting the need to tailor health programs to the individual needs of patients with varying degrees of physical activity.}
