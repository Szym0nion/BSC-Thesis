\newcommand{\Streszczenie}{Praca inżynierska skupia się na opracowaniu i implementacji aplikacji mobilnej mającej na celu monitorowanie czasu reakcji, oraz stworzeniu układu zbierającego informacje o saturacji krwi i fali tętna. Badania zostały przeprowadzone na trzech różnych grupach pacjentów: osobach nieaktywnych fizycznie, kolarzach oraz himalaistach.

W ramach projektu, opracowano aplikację mobilną, której głównym zadaniem jest pomiar czasu reakcji użytkownika na określone bodźce. Aplikacja została zoptymalizowana pod kątem precyzji pomiarów, a zebrane dane posłużyły do analizy szybkości reakcji w różnych grupach badawczych.

Dodatkowo, zaimplementowano układ pomiarowy zdolny monitorować saturację krwi oraz falę tętna. Układ ten został zastosowany w badaniach na trzech grupach pacjentów. W grupie osób nieaktywnych fizycznie, analizowano wpływ braku aktywności fizycznej na parametry zdrowotne. W przypadku kolarzy, oceniano adaptacje układu krążenia do intensywnego wysiłku fizycznego, natomiast w grupie himalaistów - wpływ ekstremalnych warunków atmosferycznych na parametry krwi.

Wyniki badań wskazują na istotne różnice pomiędzy grupami, co potwierdza zróżnicowane reakcje organizmu w zależności od poziomu aktywności fizycznej i specyfiki wykonywanej działalności. Wyniki te mogą mieć istotne znaczenie dla dziedziny medycyny sportowej oraz rehabilitacji, sugerując konieczność dostosowania programów zdrowotnych do indywidualnych potrzeb pacjentów o różnym stopniu aktywności fizycznej}

\newcommand{\StreszczenieANG}{The engineering thesis focuses on the development and implementation of a mobile application aimed at monitoring reaction time, as well as the creation of a system collecting information on blood oxygen saturation and pulse wave. The research was conducted on three different groups of patients: physically inactive individuals, cyclists, and Himalayan climbers.

As part of the project, a mobile application was developed, with its primary task being the measurement of user reaction time to specific stimuli. The application was optimized for measurement precision, and the collected data were used to analyze reaction speed in various research groups.

Additionally, a measurement system capable of monitoring blood oxygen saturation and pulse wave was implemented. This system was applied in studies involving three groups of patients. In the group of physically inactive individuals, the impact of a lack of physical activity on health parameters was analyzed. For cyclists, adaptations of the circulatory system to intense physical exertion were evaluated, while in the Himalayan climber group, the influence of extreme atmospheric conditions on blood parameters was examined.

The research results indicate significant differences between the groups, confirming varied physiological responses depending on the level of physical activity and the nature of the performed activities. These findings may have significant implications for the field of sports medicine and rehabilitation, suggesting the need to tailor health programs to the individual needs of patients with varying degrees of physical activity.}
